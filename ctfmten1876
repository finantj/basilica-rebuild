St John and the Angel
 
Fifth Scene in the Visions of the Apocalypse Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Revelation  22:1-7
 
John and the angel sit on a mountainside in the wilderness of Patmos,
which the shrubberies subtly depict. John seems to rest his chin on his
right hand as the angel points back toward the fresco of the Fall of
Babylon, which tells the viewer that all the scenes in the Apocalypse
cycle have been revealed to John by the angel sent by Jesus. John’s
gaze into the distance insinuates that he is in the act of seeing the
visions that the angel reveals. Concurrently, the scene may also depict
the angel showing John the new Jerusalem (Rev 21:1-27), upon which John
gazes beyond the fresco.
 
While the fresco itself does not suffer much structural damage, the
oxidation of the paint’s white lead has drastically obscured the scene
by making the two figures and surrounding landscape appear as “negative”
images.
