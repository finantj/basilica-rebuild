The Marriage Feast at Cana
 
Ninth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
John 2:1-12
 
The bride, with her head richly adorned, and the bridegroom are sitting
at a long table, which  takes up the entire length of the scene. On the
right there is a door covered with a curtain. To the left of the bride,
Mary is sitting; while Jesus is sitting at the left end of the table,
on a higher seat with his hands extended toward the steward on the right
who hands the cup to the groom. Mary bends her head towards her Son,
so that their haloes intercross. This is the moment when she points out
to Jesus that they have run out of wine. The forefront center represents
the fulfillment of Jesus’ command. Two servants with lifted tunics carry
jugs full of water to pour them into the six hydrias, which are marked
with letters. Another servant takes some to the master of the table for
him to taste. From the right door comes out another servant carrying
a napkin on his arm and waits at table. The table is richly laid, and
everything is minutely represented: dishes, cups, utensils, food, fish,
bread, roasted pigeons, etc.
 
Within the context of the bay, Christ’s miracle at Cana relates to
Francis’s three “miracle scenes” (lower register).
 
Christ’s figure is almost completely destroyed, and his face is
unfortunately missing. Likewise, the two figures to the right of the
groom are badly damaged. Besides the paint erosion, the rest of the
scene is rather clear.
