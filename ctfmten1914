The Death of Mary
 
Second Scene in the Lower Life of the Virgin Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 119
 
Mary’s dormition has now moved from inside to outside the Cosmatesque arch
so as to accommodate the large crowd, which the Golden Legend describes:
“About the third hour of the night Jesus came with companies of angels,
troops of prophets, hosts of martyrs, a legion of confessors and choirs
of virgins, and all took their places before the Virgin’s throne and
sang dulcet canticles.” Centered beneath the arch, the large figure of
Jesus stands behind His Mother. In His arms, He holds Himself as a Child
to emphasize to the viewer that He was born of the Virgin. Angels stand
in the top row, followed by prophets, then virgins, and the martyrs and
confessors below. On the left, the apostles stand at Mary’s head.
 
The Fresco’s left side suffers structural damage from top to
bottom. Unfortunately this damage has removed Mary’s head and many of the
apostles. In addition, the oxidation of the paint’s white lead has further
obscured the fresco by making the figures appear as “negative” images. The
blue behind Jesus give a glimpse of the fresco’s former splendor.
