The Near Sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham
 
Eleventh Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (1288-90)
 
Genesis 22:1-18
 
Brandishing a sword, Abraham is about to strike his son Isaac, who is
tied up upon a large stone altar. Just as Abraham commits to sacrificing
his son, God’s hand, surrounded by red lightning, appears to him from
the sky. Abraham’s excitement and tension in this dramatic instant
are expressed not only in the lineaments of his face but also in the
fluctuating movement of his mantle. In the lower left part of the scene
it is still possible to distinguish the ram that was entangled in a
nearby thorn bush (Gen 22:13). Above the ram, a town emerges from the
mountainside. Different from Noah, the Patriarch who lived before the
Flood, Abraham has a halo.
 
Within the context of the bay, Abraham’s near sacrifice of Isaac relates
to Francis’s willingness to forsake all and follow God by renouncing
his earthly possessions (lower register).
 
Several sections of the fresco’s left is severely damaged or completely
destroyed. This, however, is not detrimental to the reading of the theme,
which stands out clearly from the representation.
