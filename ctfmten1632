The Visitation
 
Second Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Luke 1:39-56
 
Within the context of the bay, the Visitation’s joyous praise over the
birth of Christ and the salvation He offers relates to Francis’s three
miracles (lower register), which signify the fulfillment of God’s promises
as revealed in Christ’s salvific power (middle register).
 
Except for a few fragments, this fresco is completely
destroyed. Unfortunately no figures are discernable; only some distant
architecture in the background can be seen.
