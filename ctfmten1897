Mary Leaves the Apostles
 
First Scene in the Lower Life of the Virgin Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 119
 
Beneath a Cosmatesque decorated arch from which three lanterns hang,
Mary lies on an elaborate blanket amongst the twelve apostles who encircle
her. The pillar-supported archway allows the viewer to peer into the house
where Mary rests on a pillow as she awaits her death. According to the
Golden Legend, in fulfillment of Mary’s request, all the apostles were
instantly snatched away from wherever they were preaching and deposited
at her house. The standing figure to the right is likely Paul’s disciple
Dionysius the Areopagite who, according to the Golden Legend and the
Divine Names, claims that he was present at the Virgin’s dormition. He
extends his right hand over Mary and carries a scroll in his left
hand. They all wait in anticipation for Mary’s death and assumption.
 
Besides the two eroded figures in the lower right corner, the fresco is
structurally intact and even retains a blue hue. However, the oxidation
of the paint’s white lead has obscured the scene by making the figures
appear as “negative” images.
