The Labors of Adam and Eve or Cherub Guarding the Garden of Eden (lost)
 
Sixth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Artist Unidentifiable (c. 1288-90)
 
Genesis 3:16-24
 
Labors and pains are the consequences of the original sin. The guilt
of Adam and Eve has destroyed the intimate link between humans and
God. However, their suffering and hardship are part of God’s plan of
salvation history. As the narrative of the nave’s fresco cycle conveys,
what was broken by the Fall is repaired by the redeeming action of Christ
– the new Adam.
 
Within the context of the bay, if this scene depicted the labors of
Adam and Eve, then it stands in contrast with Francis born aloft
in ecstasy (lower register). The topology suggests that Francis’s
life of Spirit-filled contemplation overcame the world’s toils and
anxieties. Thus, the fruit of Francis’s ecstasy is intimacy with God
instead of the fruits of sin.
 
The fresco is thoroughly destroyed.
