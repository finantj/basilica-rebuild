Isaac Blesses Jacob
 
Thirteenth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Isaac Master (Arnolfo di Cambio?) (c. 1290)
 
Genesis 27:1-29
 
The scene occurs in a room surmounted by a roof and adorned with
columns. Rebecca, Isaac’s wife and Jacob’s mother, lifts up the curtain
that hides the bed. Jacob, represented with a halo, has drawn near to
the bed of his sick father. Isaac, also with halo, is sitting on the
bed with his back upright, propped up with the help of a maidservant,
whose face is almost completely hidden behind Isaac’s halo. Jacob’s hands
and neck are wrapped up in kidskins; his blind father grasps his right
hand, and he holds a bowl of food in his left hand. The fresco catches
the exact moment described in Genesis, when Isaac pronounces the words:
“Come near, my son, so that I may touch you and know whether you are
really my son Esau or not” (Gen 27:21).
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene mimics the approval of the
Rule fresco (lower register), which is emphasized by the twelve friars
that correspond to Israel’s twelve tribes descended from Jacob.
 
Some of the area between Isaac and Jacob is destroyed, but it does not
significantly detract from the scene’s action.
