Layout
 
The architectural layout of the upper basilica is T-shaped, or cruciform,
i.e., the nave's four bays end at the transept and pentagonal apse,
which are all connected by eight cross vaults. A narrow walkway gallery
wraps the entire architectural perimeter, with doorways cutting through
the pillared columns. The basilica's thirteenth century frescoes form an
iconographic program that illustrates the continuity between the Old and
New Testaments in the story of salvation, highlighting the roles of Jesus
Christ, Mary, the Church and St Francis in that salvation. Specifically,
each of the basilica's five basic parts (nave, transept, apse, vaults,
windows) presents distinct pictorial cycles, which contribute different
elements to the overarching theme of salvation history. The life of the
Church is the main theme of the apse and transept while the prefiguration
and imitation of Christ is the nave's main theme. Thus, the dual message
of Christ and His Church dominate the sacred space.
