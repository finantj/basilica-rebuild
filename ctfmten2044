St Peter Heals the Sick and Casts Out Unclean Spirits
 
Second Scene in the Lives of the Apostles Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Acts 5:12-16
 
Standing in front of a representation of Solomon’s Portico, St Peter,
accompanied by three Apostles, cures a “great number of people” who came
to him to be healed. In front, some lay on cots and mats while others
lunge forward. Above the crowd a gaggle of devils flee as Peter heals
the possessed. The crowd contains both men and women; one woman holds
a child. All gaze at Peter in the hope of being healed. The woman in
front reaches out to Peter with both hands. Reciprocally, Peter extends
both his hands in a gesture of healing. In the top left corner, the rays
emanating from the cloud make it clear that Peter heals by God’s power.
 
Much of the scene’s structure is well preserved, but the oxidation of
the paint’s white lead has obscured the fresco by making the figures
appear as “negative” images.
