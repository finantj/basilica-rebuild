The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple
 
Fifth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters (c. 1290)
 
Luke 2:21-40
 
Mary and Joseph are standing on the scene’s right. Joseph holds the
turtledoves prescribed for the sacrifice. On the opposite side there is
the representation of Simeon and the prophet Anna. Simeon holds the Child
in his arms. Mary looks at her Child, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and
His look is turned back towards her. Mary’s solemn look and outstretched
arms that reach for her Child depict Simeon’s blessing, “a sword will
pierce your own soul too” (Lk 2:34-35). Simon holds the Baby over a richly
decorated altar. The altar stands below a sort of ciborium, supported by
twisted columns. High up one can see the tent lifted up on the two sides.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene connects the brothers’ anguish
and joy over Francis’s death (lower register) with the Holy Family’s
anguish and joy over Jesus’ salvific destiny as conveyed by Simeon and
Anna’s bittersweet comments regarding the Messiah.
 
Besides the rather serious fading of the paint, this fresco is in good
condition.
