The Crucifixion of St Peter
 
Fourth Scene in the Lives of the Apostles Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 89
 
According to a tradition, St Peter was executed in Rome during the reign
of Nero. In the fresco’s center hangs the crucified St Peter who, the
tradition claims, was crucified upside down because he did not consider
himself worthy of dying in the same manner as Jesus Christ. The two
pyramids in the background are two monuments signifying ancient Rome: the
meta Remi (pyramid of Remus) on the left, and the meta Romuli (pyramid
of Romulus) on the right. The foreground of both pyramids contains
crowds. The meta Remi has a large crowd of non-haloed male figures,
the first of whom carries a sword and extends his left hand toward
St Peter. The meta Romuli has a small crowd of three haloed figures,
two of whom carry swords. St Peter looks toward these figures. The
architectural significance of the iconography suggests that those on the
left who crucified Peter will succumb to the same fate as Remus, while the
successors of St Peter on the right will continue the Holy Roman Empire.
 
The fresco’s structure is relatively well preserved, but the now oxidized
white lead has obscured the fresco.
