The Adoration of the Magi
 
Fourth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman and Building Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Matthew 2:1-12
 
In the left of the scene, one can still recognize the crowns and legs/feet
of two of the Wise Men. The third offers his gift as he kneels in front
of Mary, who is sitting on a throne, holding Jesus in her lap. A building
looms behind her. The Infant’s right hand extends toward the visitors
in hospitable greeting.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene indicates that those who honor
Francis (lower register) are like the wise men who honor Christ.
 
The faces of all the figures have been destroyed, except a small portion
of Mary’s face, which gazes down to the visitors who homage her Son.
