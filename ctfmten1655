The Ascension
 
Second Fresco in the Chiastic Structure of the Counter Façade
 
Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Matthew 28:16-20; Mark 16:19-20; Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:6-12
 
Christ, with His head surrounded by the cross nimbus, wears a red
tunic and a flowing brown mantle. His feet, wrapped in a cloud, rise
heavenwards, symbolically represented by three concentric circles. The
sublime gesture of Christ’s body and hands express His intense desire
to enter heavenly glory. Below Him, on the right, the Apostles’ eyes
follow Him heavenwards. Above the Apostles, an angel hovers with arms
extended. He is wearing a white gown with a crossed stole. On the left
the traces of another Angel are discernible.
 
Within the context of the counter-façade, this scene depicts Christ
reaching toward heaven in a posture that mimics Francis’s (below
left). The ascended Christ sends the Holy Spirit to the disciples at
Pentecost (left). Thus, this fresco recounts Acts 1:1-11, which is
followed by the Pentecost episode of Acts 2:1-13 in the next scene of
the chiasm.
 
Most of the lower section of this fresco is destroyed, but the
well-preserved upper section beautifully depicts Christ’s ascension.
