Christ and Mary in Glory
 
Fourth Scene in the Lower Life of the Virgin Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 119
 
Wearing the same radiant mantle as in the previous fresco, Mary sits
atop a huge, elaborate throne next to her Son Jesus who holds a book
in his left arm. On the right of the throne the company of prophets,
martyrs, virgins, confessors and apostles are again present. On the
left of the throne, a group of Franciscans now appear and kneel with
clasped hands below the angels. Leading this group, Francis stands
just to the left of Mary’s feet and looks at Christ who returns the
gaze. Between them, Mary intercedes for Francis and his brothers. Her
head turns toward her Son while her right arm extends toward Francis in
a gesture of presentation. Christ responds by extending his right hand
to bless Francis and his followers. This fascinating addition seems to
juxtapose the Friars with the company on the right, which suggests that
the Franciscans are the new prophets, martyrs, virgins, confessors and
apostles in a new age in the Church.
 
The fresco is structurally intact, even retaining the blue color behind
the throne. However, some of the figures’ faces have eroded and the
oxidation of the paint’s white lead has further obscured the scene by
making the fresco appear as a “negative” image.
