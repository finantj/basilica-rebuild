St Francis and Two Angels

Francis gestures toward Mary with both hands; in turn, Mary’s hands
gesture toward Jesus.
 
The inscription reads:
Pray for Us Saint Francis
 
The identification of Francis along with Jesus, Mary and John is
significant because the Roman Catholic Church calendar only observes three
birthdays: Jesus (December 25), Mary (September 8) and John the Baptist
(June 24). In effect, the inclusion of Francis with the other three,
suggests that many considered Francis to symbolize a new birth within the
Church. The Golden Legend captures this popular sentiment: “Note that
the Church solemnizes only three birthdays, namely, those of Christ,
of holy Mary, and of John the Baptist. These three birthdays mark three
spiritual births, for we are reborn in water with John, in penance with
Mary, and in glory with Christ.” Just as the pairing of Mary and John
signifies that the birth of baptism is one of penance and forgiveness,
the pairing of Jesus and Francis signifies that the birth into Christ’s
glory is through humility and poverty as exemplified by Francis. The
prominence of Francis’s stigmata further suggests that Christ’s glory
ultimately reveals itself in His self-emptying on the cross.
