The Fall of Simon Magus
 
Third Scene in the Lives of the Apostles Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 89; Acts 8:9-24
 
In the fresco’s center, framed by architecture that scales the tower’s
great height, stands a scaffold from which Simon Magus, crowned with a
laurel, throws himself and begins to fly to heaven. His flight results
from the magical assistance of five demons who keep him airborne. Four
demons hold each limb and the fifth rides on Simon’s back, who turns
his head and looks down toward St Peter. In the lower left, Peter, with
St Paul kneeling in prayer behind him, points his right index finger at
Simon as he commands the demons, in the name of Jesus Christ, to drop
their master and allow him plummet to the earth. Thereupon, Simon fell,
broke his neck and died. In the lower right, Nero, seated in a throne and
holding a fleur-de-lys rod, watches the entire spectacle. He sits beneath
a grand cupola topped building and is accompanied by three aids. Since
Peter killed Simon, who was a Nero’s friend, Nero threatened to destroy
Peter and Paul, which the next two frescos depict.
 
Besides the paint erosion in the foreground and the crack in the upper
right, much of the structure is well preserved. However, the oxidation
of the paint’s white lead has obscured the fresco.
