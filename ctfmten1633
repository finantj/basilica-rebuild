The Nativity and the Announcement to the Shepherds
 
Third Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman and Building Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Luke 2:1-20; Matthew 1:18-25
 
This very well preserved fresco follows the Byzantine tradition in
essential lines of its composition. Mary, wrapped in a green mantle over
a brown tunic, is lying on a white, decorated piece of cloth. Her figure
dominates the scene’s center. A little higher up, sideways, in a cave,
the infant Jesus lays in a manger flanked by an ox and a donkey. The cross
nimbus of Christ’s halo is barely visible. The form of the cave and the
mountain simulates a flattened tent, endowed with a little opening that
allows the viewer look inside. Joseph is sitting on the scene’s lower
left. His head leans on his left hand in a rather pensive mood. In the
right corner, two shepherds appear with their sheep. Above, there are
four angels: two of them look upwards, and the other two descend towards
the child. One points at the shepherds, while the other holds a scroll
and blesses the shepherds. The scroll reads: “Annuntio vobis” that is,
“I announce to you” (Lk 2:10-11).
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene indicates that those who
venerate Francis (lower register) share the life of the Holy Family who
humbly receive Christ.
 
This is one of the best-preserved frescoes of the New Testament upper
register.
