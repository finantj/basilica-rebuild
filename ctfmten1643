The Raising of Lazarus from the Dead
 
Tenth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
John 11:17-44
 
The fresco is so destroyed that it is hardly possible to recognize its
theme. On the left, three haloed persons are distinguishable. Two of
them are apostles. The one on the left is probably Peter. Below them,
there are traces of a kneeling figure, probably Martha, beseeching Jesus
to give her brother life again.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene parallels Christ’s raising
of Lazarus with Francis’s miraculous raising of the dead woman (lower
register).
