The Angel of the Seventh Seal and the Angels of the Four Winds of the Earth’s Four Corners
 
Second Scene in the Visions of the Apocalypse Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Revelations 7:1-4
 
In the fresco’s foreground, four angels standing at the earth’s four
corners, hold back the earth’s four winds as protection from the wrath of
the sixth seal. In their left hand, each of the angels holds a tornado
funnel. At the top of the scene, one can still see the angel of the
seventh seal ascending from the rising sun. The wall behind the angels
protects the one hundred forty-four thousand servants of God who inhabit
the dwellings. The sloping mountains frame the ascending angel and point
toward the citadel below.
 
The oxidation of the paint’s white lead has obscured the fresco by
making the figures appear as “negative” images. However, the angels robe,
rising sun and citadel offers a glimpse of the fresco’s earlier color.
