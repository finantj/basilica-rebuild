Enthroned Christ Flanked by the Four Evangelists
 
Sixth Scene in the Lives of the Apostles Cycle
 
Gothic Workshop (c. 1275-80)
 
Revelations 4:6-8; Ezekiel 1:5-14
 
Centered in the lunette, Christ sits in an elaborate gable-front throne
surrounded by the four living creatures that symbolize the evangelists:
the top right man for Matthew and the lower right ox for Luke are visible;
the top left eagle for John, and the lower left lion for Mark are almost
completely missing. Each of the creatures holds the corresponding book
of the gospel. The fresco belongs to the Apostle Cycle because it shows
that the evangelists were either apostles (Matthew and John) or associated
with the apostles (Mark with Peter and Luke with Paul)
 
Much of this fresco is destroyed including the central figure of the
enthroned Christ. This is particularly unfortunate considering that this
is one of the only frescos in the apse/transept that does not appear to
have been painted mostly with the now oxidized white lead.
