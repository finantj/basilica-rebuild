The Apse
 
The apse contains two closely related cycles that comprise the Life of
the Virgin Cycle, which is arranged in two registers. The four frescoes of
the apse's lower register covers events from the end of Mary's life. The
four scenes of the upper register above the two two-pillared galleries
covers the back-story to Mary's birth and marriage. These scenes signify
the Church that symbolically comes from Mary just as Christ was born
of her. The archways above the two two-pillared galleries depict three
prophets holding scrolls (south) and three prelates holding books (north),
and are surmounted by two depictions of the virgin flanked by angels
(south) and Joachim, Anne and Joseph (north). The five archways of
the apse contain sixteen prophets in the upper register and thirty-six
prophets and angels in the three window archways. The east wall of the
apse contains three sets of stained glass. Each set contains a two-light
window topped by a rose window flanked by decorative glass. The papal
throne with its six steps and pillared canopy resides beneath the central
window. Two lions standing over their prey serve as armrests, and a string
of animals decorate the sixth step footrest. Two unidentified saint-popes
flank the throne. The upper church's frescoed decoration first began in
the apse. It was started by the French Gothic 'Master from beyond the
Mountains' and completed by Cimabue's workshop during the mid-1270's.
