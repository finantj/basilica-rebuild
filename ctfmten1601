The Creation of the World 
 
First Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Jacopo Torriti (c. 1288-90)
 
Genesis 1:1-2:3
 
Inside a series of concentric rings, a symbol of perfection, there
is the figure of Christ as the Pancreator, whose halo, interestingly,
does not contain a cross nimbus. The features of His face are clearly
Byzantine. In the first ring closest to Christ, there are delicately
painted busts of angels, their faces and eyes turned to Him. The second
ring consists of pearl-shaped decoration. The small third ring contains
the primordial waters of Gen 1:2. The outer ring shows the signs of
the fourth day of creation: on the left, stars and a face-like sun,
on the right the crescent of a moon. Beyond the outer ring, where
Christ’s right hand blesses, the “Light” appears as a naked youth,
with his fluctuating robe hanging on one arm within the center of a
radiant mandorla-shaped ornament. He descends towards earth while his
eyes and hand point to the origin of the eternal light (Gen 1:17). On
the left, “Darkness” is personified as a sitting, naked woman who gazes
back toward Christ, but does not point to Him. The rest of the fresco
represents the whole process of creation apart from man. Land, sea,
plants and various animals emanate an atmosphere of harmonious order,
a consequence of devout dependence on God the Creator. The divine Spirit,
represented as a dove, hovers above the waters (Gen 1:2).
 
This scene begins the pictorial narrative of all the nave’s cycles and
affirms that all creation comes forth from God as a gracious gift. Within
the specific context of the bay, it shows that just as God created all
that exists, God renewed creation through the covenant with Noah after
the flood (middle register), and recreates Francis as the “new man” who
conformed himself to Christ (lower register).
 
Even with the destruction above and to the right of Christ, this is one
of the best-preserved frescoes of the Old Testament upper register.
