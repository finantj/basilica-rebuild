The Kiss of Judas and the Arrest of Jesus
 
Eleventh Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Master of the Arrest (c. 1288-90)
 
Matthew 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:1-14
 
This well-preserved fresco depicts a large horde of soldiers and a few
Pharisees who have entered the garden on the Mount of Olives. The Lord
meets them as Judas approaches from the left to kiss Him, and the angry
cohort surround Him from behind. This disposition puts into particular
relief the two main figures that dominate the scene. The representation
stresses the victory of the Son of God more than the betrayal of
Judas. Judas is a simple tool and, as such, he must fulfill his mission.
 
Christ is wearing a brown robe. His left hand holds a scroll. His right
hand extends behind Judas in the act of healing the slave’s ear, which
Peter cuts off. Jesus’ healing act and dignified figure emanates strength
and compassion, even though His face reflects the dramatic gravity of His
mission. Judas, on the contrary, is represented with a look of complete
falsity. The faces of the soldiers and Pharisees have characteristic
features; particularly brutal is the physiognomy of the man who, from the
right, lays his hands on Jesus. The soldiers wear helmets and are armed
with long spears, clubs and lanterns, which the Gospel of John mentions.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene insinuates that those
who doubt Francis’s sanctity (lower register) betray Christ like
Judas. Specifically, rejection of the stigmata is paramount to rejecting
Christ.
 
This is one of the best-preserved frescoes of the New Testament lower
register.
