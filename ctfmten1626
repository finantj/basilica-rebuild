Genesis 37:1-36
 
On the scene’s right, it is possible to discern a quadrangular well
(Byzantine style) on a step-like plinth. The haloed Joseph, who is
represented very small for his age, is being lowered by two brothers
into the well as his other brothers watch. The group is made of five
persons: two of them are busy with Joseph, two are looking at each
other, and the fifth person, standing behind the well in dark dress,
is indistinguishable. In the background, two mountains, dotted with
a few small trees, cross their slopes where the action of the well
transpires. On the right mountain there are two sheep, a black one and
a white one, while on the left mountain there are nine sheep. The four
figures to the left represent the Ismaelite Merchants to whom Joseph’s
brothers sold him.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene relates to the four “peace
scenes” wherein Francis is depicted as a man of peace (lower register).
 
Much of the fresco is destroyed, but the composition still comes out
quite clearly.
