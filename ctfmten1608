The Fall
 
Fourth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Genesis 3:1-21
 
Adam stands on the left of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. His
right hand hides his nakedness with a leaf, which means he has already
succumbed to temptation. The tree of knowledge of good and evil stands at
the center. The serpent, with a woman’s face, twists all around the tree
in long spirals and turns its head towards Eve, who stands to the right.
 
Within the context of the bay, the scene contrasts with Francis’s
renunciation of his possessions and decisive decision to obey God
(lower register). Moreover, the shame of Adam and Eve’s nudity contrasts
with Francis who stands naked and unashamed before God’s blessing hand
(lower register).
 
Eve’s figure is almost completely destroyed, just a few fragments are
left. The theme of the original transgression, though, is still clearly
detectable.
