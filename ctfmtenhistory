History
 
Pope Gregory IX's decree, 'Recolentes qualiter' (April 29, 1228),
formally calls for a burial church to be built to honor St. Francis. Soon
thereafter, Gregory himself laid the first stone of the lower church
the day after Francis's canonization on July 16, 1228. Brother Elias
of Cortona, second Minister General of the Franciscan Order (1232-39),
is likely the architect who designed the double church. His tenacity
brought the completion of the lower church in 1230. The saint's body,
which had been resting in the church of St George (Francis's parish
church and the future church of St Clare), was then secretly brought
to the new church and buried in a hidden location on May 25, 1230.
Fear of looting by relic seekers was the reason for the secrecy and
it was so effective that the tomb was not rediscovered until 1819. It
is unclear when work began on the upper church, but Elias's untiring
fundraising and supervision aided in the substantial completion of the
upper church's architecture by 1236-39. To some, Elias's efforts to build
such a splendid church in honor of the 'poverello' were excessive, and
this sentiment contributed to his removal as Minister General in 1239. A
building hiatus likely ensued after Elias's removal. Nevertheless, Pope
Innocent IV (1243-54) consecrated the altars of both the lower and upper
churches on May 25, 1253, before work began on the fresco decorations of
the upper church. The delay in the consecration may have been political
rather than architectural given that the deposed Elias died in Cortona
on April 2, 1253, and the church was consecrated soon after his death
on May 25, 1253. Pope Nicholas IV (1288-92), i.e., Girolamo Masci the
former Minister General of the Franciscan Order (1274-79), raised the
church to the status of papal basilica in 1288.
