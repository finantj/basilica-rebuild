Noah and the Animals Enter the Ark
 
Tenth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (1288-90)
 
Genesis 7:1-10
 
A half-open lid in the shape of an enormous rectangular case surmounts
the ark. It is possible to see the head of a man and, on the gangway
connecting the ark to the land, a ram is moving onwards. Out of a small
window of the ark, with brick-like decorations, the head and paws of a
lion protrude, giving the fresco a particularly lively character. The
“lid” of the case, i.e., the roof of the ark, is kept open by bars. A
bird rests on the roof, while only the tail of another bird is visible.
 
Within the context of the bay, the new creation of Noah’s covenant
with God parallels Francis’s initial conversion and new life (lower
register). Specifically, just as the ark symbolizes the rebirth of
creation, Christ’s offer of the splendid palace signifies the “new
creation” of Francis’s conversion.
 
The fresco is mostly destroyed. From what is still recognizable, this
must have been a very powerful and dynamic scene.
