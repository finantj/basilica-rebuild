The Flight to Egypt
 
Sixth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters (c. 1290)
 
Matthew 2:13-15
 
The fresco is almost completely missing. Only Joseph (on the right)
can be seen. The tree in the background signals that the holy family is
traveling through the wilderness. Such iconography helps identify the
fresco as the theme of “Flight to Egypt.”
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene connects the brothers’ anguish
over Francis’s death (lower register) with the Holy Family’s anguish
during their fight into Egypt to avoid Herod’s slaughter.
 
Much of the fresco is destroyed, but the scene’s theme can still be
identified.
