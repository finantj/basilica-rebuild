St Luke and Greece
 
Vault of the Evangelists
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
A winged ox, the symbol for Luke, resides at the base of Luke’s desk
as an angel reaches toward his ear signifying that his gospel was
inspired. Tradition holds that Luke wrote his gospel in Greece; hence
the inscription: Ipnacchaia.
