The Annunciation
 
First Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Luke 1:26-38
 
The south/right wall fresco of the annunciation of the Lord, i.e.,
the new creation, corresponds to the creation of the world, i.e., the
Creation of the north/left wall.
 
The Virgin is represented in the right of the scene. Behind her stands
a high seat, representing the dignity of the Lord’s Mother. The standing
Virgin turns towards the Angel on the left. He is the Archangel Gabriel,
the Angel of the Lord. With raised wings and slightly bent knee, he
lifts his right hand in a blessing gesture. The Virgin’s head is slightly
inclined towards him. In her left hand she holds an open book. Her right
gestures toward the angel suggesting that she has heard the message and
has given her consent: “Here I am, the Lord’s servant, let it be with
me according to your word” (Lk 1:38).
 
Within the context of the bay, the Annunciation’s proclamation of the
Good News of God’s Kingdom parallels Francis’s three miracles (lower
register), which signify Christ’s salvific power that fulfills God’s
promises (middle register).
 
Several sections of the fresco’s is seriously damaged or completely
destroyed. The Angel’s face is missing, and Mary’s figure has
eroded. However, the damage does not completely obscure the scene’s theme,
which stands out clearly from the representation.
