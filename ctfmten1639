Jesus among the Teachers in the Temple
 
Seventh Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters, Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Luke 2:41-52
 
In a closed milieu, the twelve-year-old Jesus sits in front of a niche. He
keeps His left hand on a scroll, while His right hand shows that He is
teaching. The teachers are sitting facing Him. Jesus directs His eyes
toward His parents who, on the fresco’s right side, have come looking
for Jesus. Only Mary’s veiled head and halo remain visible.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene illustrates that just as Jesus
was a teacher, Francis too taught with authority, as the four “preaching
scenes” portray (lower register).
 
The painting is badly damaged. However, one can clearly recognize the
scene of Jesus among the teachers.
