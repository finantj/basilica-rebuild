Mary Magdalene and Others Visit the Tomb
 
Sixteenth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters, Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-18
 
Atop a rectangular sarcophagus two winged angels sit; the left angel
holds a rod. In front of them four guards are asleep. To the left, the
barely discernable figures of two women enter the scene. Both angels
point to the burial cloths and announce to them that the Lord is no
longer there because he has risen from the dead, signified by Jesus’
linen cloths that remain upon the empty sarcophagus.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene indicates that Christ’s
resurrection was a consistent theme of Francis’s preaching as conveyed
in the four “preaching scenes” (lower register).
 
Much of the upper half of the fresco has been destroyed, and Mary
Magdalene and her companion are almost entirely destroyed. However the
iconography clearly indicates the fresco’s theme.
