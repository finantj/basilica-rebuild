The Pentecost
 
Third Fresco in the Chiastic Structure of the Counter Façade
 
Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Acts 2:1-13
 
Against the background of a Gothic building that opens to the front with
three gabled round arches, Mary and the twelve Apostles are sitting in an
open hall. Mary occupies the scene’s center, while two Apostles are on her
right and two on her left. Four more Apostles, their backs to the viewer,
are sitting on a long Cosmatesque decorated bench. Two Apostles each
occupy the two ends of the bench. This representation fixes the moment
when the Holy Spirit descends over Mary and the Apostles. The Spirit
appears above the Gothic building in the form of a white dove flying
downwards and surrounded by a triple circle of light. White tongues
of fire with reddening tips quiver around the circle. The upper circle
emits thirteen rays that descend over the persons in the hall.
 
Within the context of the counter-façade, the descending Holy Spirit
from the three-ringed celestial orb mimics the three concentric circles
representing heaven (right), and the bird that flies toward Francis
(lower right). Thus the Spirit is sent by Christ and is sent to Francis
to inspire his preaching.
 
The right side of the fresco that extends into the area between the
apostles is completely destroyed. The faces of several figures have
entirely or partially eroded. However, the well-preserved upper section
beautifully depicts the Holy Spirit and descending tongues of fire.
