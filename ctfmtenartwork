Artwork
 
No other thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Italian architectural space
has been so lavishly adorned with the innovation and creative power of
artistic genius. The realization of the basilica's iconographic program
was entrusted to a group of artists drawn from all over Europe, endowed
with different styles and artistic expression: the Roman Jacopo Torriti,
Pietro Cavallini and Filippo Rusuti, the Sienese Duccio di Boninsegna,
the Florentine Cimabue and the young Giotto. Other unknown masters
like the Umbrian 'St Francis Master,' the French 'Master from beyond
the Mountains,' the Italian 'Isaac Master' (Arnolfo di Cambio?), and
the Roman, German and French 'workshops' also contributed their artistic
expertise. Such collaboration among Europe's best artisans was a catalyst
for a new age in European art: the birth of realism via the recovery of
the three-dimensional, spatial perspective. In short, the upper church
was decorated by the greatest medieval artists of their time, giving the
upper church of the Basilica of Saint Francis an unequalled importance in
the development of European art.
