This scene fixes the moment between the deposition from the cross and the
burial of Jesus. It highlights the immense sadness Christ’s death caused
His faithful disciples. Christ, wearing only a loincloth, is lying down
on a red piece of fabric. The kneeling Mary supports her dead Son with
her right arm, and, with her left arm around His waist, she embraces
Him. On the other end, Mary Magdalene kisses the Lord’s left foot and
John, kneeling at her side, bends reverentially over the dead Master,
kissing His left hand. On the right, behind Magdalene and John, there are
two haloed men standing; the dress of the figure with the crossed hands
suggests he may be Joseph of Arimathea. On the left side, only women are
represented. Between the Virgin and John there is another woman who lays
her hand on her own face in an attitude of deep sorrow. Kneeling behind
Mary to the left is another haloed woman who throws her arms up as she
mourns. Behind the figure of Mary, two women talk animatedly to each
other as they walk towards the burial place. Next to them, two more women
watch from afar. High up, four angels show deep grief and lamentation.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene indicates that Christ’s death
was a consistent theme of Francis’s preaching as conveyed in the four
“preaching scenes” (lower register).
 
Unfortunately, the faces of several figures, including Christ, Mary, Mary
Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea, have been entirely or mostly destroyed.
