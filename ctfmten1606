The Creation of Eve
 
Third Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Genesis 1:26-31; 2:18-25
 
As in the fresco of Adam’s creation, the Creator is sitting on the
celestial sphere. Turning a little to the left he extends His right hand
and gives life to Eve. The garden of Eden is symbolically represented by
two trees and several plants. In front of Eve Adam lies deeply asleep
(Gen 2:21). Eve turns to the Creator with grateful eyes and raises her
hands, with her left one stretched towards Him in a gesture of thanks.
 
Within the context of the bay, the scene connects with Francis’s
rebuilding of the Church, i.e., the new Eve, brought forth from the new
Adam, Christ, to whom Francis conforms (lower register).
 
Apart from Adam’s face, unfortunately missing, the fresco is relatively
well preserved.
