Esau before Isaac
 
Fourteenth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Isaac Master (Arnolfo di Cambio?) (c. 1290)
 
Genesis 27:30-45
 
In the room already painted in the previous fresco, blind Isaac is lying
on his bed, with his bust a little lifted up and leaning on his right
elbow. On his left side there stands his son Esau accompanied by his
Cananite wife. Behind them, a blue clad Rebecca, with back turned to
Esau, exits the room. Having already exited the room, the haloed Jacob,
on the far right, turns back to hear Rebecca’s warning of Esau’s revenge
(Gen 27:42-43). With Jacob’s exit, Esau enters (Gen 27:30). He wears
a yellow tunic and a green mantle, and his hands and neck are covered
with hairs. He offers a spoonful of his father’s favorite food. Rebecca
follows him timidly, keeping herself in the background. By now Isaac has
understood the deception. His gropingly raised left arm, his right arm
bent back in a gesture of surprise, his closed eyes, and the frown, all
reveal the overwhelming pain he is suffering. It is a moving illustration
of the biblical passage: “Then Isaac trembled violently and said:
‘who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all
before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and blessed he shall be”
(Gen 27:32-33).  Also Esau’s gaze and Rebecca’s timorous attitude are
painted with realistic likelihood.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene again relates to the approval
of the Rule fresco (lower register). Just as Jacob unexpectedly received
Isaac’s blessing instead of Esau, the poor and humble friars receive
the pope’s blessing instead of more traditional forms of religious life,
as might have been expected.
 
Apart from Jacob’s face and the very top of the scene, the fresco is
well preserved.
