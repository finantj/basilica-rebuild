The Transfiguration 
 
First Scene in the Passion and Glory of Christ Cycle
 
Gothic Workshop (c. 1275-80)
 
Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-10; Luke 9:28-36
 
Centered in the lunette, Christ stands within a three-ringed, blue
mandorla holding an orb in his left hand. Seven sets of rays emanate
from the mandorla. From the cloud to the left, the figure of God the
Father points to Christ signifying His proclamation, “This is my Son, the
Beloved; listen to Him!” Below God the Father, Moses, depicted with horns,
genuflects as he talks with Jesus; to the right Elijah also genuflects
during their conversation. Below them are James, Peter and John, who all
fall back in terrified awe. To the left, the scant remnant of a halo
likely identifies John. In the center Peter looks up as he poses the
question to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three
dwellings: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” To the right
is the bearded James (John is usually depicted as a youth without beard).
 
The bottom-half of the fresco is mostly destroyed, and the oxidation
of the paint’s white lead has further obscured the fresco by making the
figures appear as “negative” images.
