Joseph Reveals Himself to His Brothers
 
Sixteenth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters, Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Genesis 45:1-28
 
A Gothic, architecturally complex palace rises against the background. In
the foreground, in an open air space, there takes place the dramatic
scene between Joseph and his brothers. Joseph is sitting on a throne
raised by two steps. His haloed head is turned towards his brothers who
occupy the scene’s center. Behind Joseph there is a soldier with a helmet
and a sword in his right hand. Between Joseph and his administrator, who
stands on the far left, the eleven brothers kneel as the administrator
raises above the brothers’ heads the cup as the “Corpus delicti” or body
of evidence (Gen 44:1-13), which incriminates Benjamin. His right hand
points towards young Benjamin, in whose bag the disappeared cup had been
found. All the brothers kneel and ask Joseph for forgiveness. In front,
Judah, already in his old age, also points to the smooth-faced, young
Benjamin, who is dressed in red on his right.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene relates to the four “peace
scenes” wherein Francis is depicted as a man of peace (lower register).
 
The fresco’s upper center and right has been destroyed, and the expression
on Joseph’s face is unfortunately missing. The rest of the scene is
crowed: the front with the large number of people and the background
with the palace’s rich architecture.
