St Matthew and Judea
 
Vault of the Evangelists
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
An winged human, the symbol for Matthew, resides at the base of Matthew’s
desk as an angel reaches toward his ear signifying that his gospel was
inspired. Tradition holds that Matthew wrote his gospel in Judea; hence
the inscription: Iudea.
