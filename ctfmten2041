St Peter and St John Heal the Lame Man 
 
First Scene in the Lives of the Apostles Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Acts 3:1-10
 
Standing in front of a representation of the Temple’s “Beautiful Gate,”
Peter, accompanied by John, extends his hands to heal the man crippled
from birth. To the right, another beggar also asks for alms. As the
lame man asks for alms, Peter responds, “I have no silver or gold,
but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
stand up and walk.” Strangely, the crippled man’s still recognizable
face is also disfigured. Such disfigurement intensifies the miracle of
Peter healing the cripple through God’s power. The crowd to the right
represents the astonished onlookers who came to watch the spectacle. The
figure in front gestures in a questioning manner. In Acts 3:11-16,
Peter explains that he does not heal by his own power, but by the God
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Who glorified Jesus.
 
The paint of the fresco’s foreground has eroded, and the oxidation of
the paint’s white lead has further obscured the fresco by making the
figures appear as “negative” images.
