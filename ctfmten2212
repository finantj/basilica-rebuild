St Mark and Italy 
 
Vault of the Evangelists
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
A winged lion, the symbol for Mark, resides at the base of Mark’s
desk as an angel reaches toward his ear signifying that his gospel was
inspired. Tradition holds that Mark wrote his gospel in Italy; hence
the inscription: Ytalia.
