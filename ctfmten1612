The Offerings of Cain and Abel (lost)
 
Seventh Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Artist Unidentifiable (c. 1290)
 
Genesis 4:1-7
 
The most frequent pattern used in the Middle Ages to portray this biblical
scene shows an altar at the center, Abel approaches from the left and
Cain from the right. Both carry their gifts. Or sometimes Abel and Cain
are already kneeling in front of the altar. Either way, above the altar,
descending from the sky, God is always represented by His hand, which
blesses Abel. Sometimes the scene is represented without the Altar.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene contrasts with Joseph’s
restoration of peace among his brothers (middle register) and the four
“peace scenes” wherein Francis is depicted as a man of peace (lower
register). Specifically, it relates to Francis’s peaceful encounter
with the Sultan. Whereas Cain’s offering is followed by Abel’s murder,
Francis offers himself as the holocaust before the Sultan. In offering
himself, Francis attempts to reconcile with his “brother.”
 
The fresco is completely destroyed.
