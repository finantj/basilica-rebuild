Cain Kills Abel
 
Eighth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters, Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Genesis 4:8-16
 
The few extant fragments are enough to reveal an idea of the scene’s
composition. Abel is lying dead on the ground. His hand, part of his body,
and his legs are just visible. On the left, the figure of Cain flees
away under God’s reproach. Cain had drawn his brother into the country,
symbolically represented by the two trees. The figure of Abel lying on
the ground tells us that Cain has already committed his crime. From above,
the barely visible hand of God announces to Cain the curse that will haunt
him from that moment onwards. Thus the “Sign of Cain” is forever present.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene contrasts with Joseph’s
restoration of peace among his brothers (middle register) and the four
“peace scenes” wherein Francis is depicted as a man of peace (lower
register).
 
Much of the fresco is destroyed, but the scene’s theme is clear.
