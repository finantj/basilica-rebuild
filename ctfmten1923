The Assumption of Mary
 
Third Scene in the Lower Life of the Virgin Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 119
 
Above an open sarcophagus, Christ cradles his mother’s body as they
ascend into glory. They sit within a mandorla, which four angels carry
heavenwards. Mary and Christ clasp hands as she rests her head on His
left shoulder. Mary’s mantle sparkles with radiant decoration. Below
the mandorla the company of prophets, martyrs, virgins, confessors
and apostles witness the spectacle. On each side of the sarcophagus,
the twelve apostles kneel with hands clasped as they watch Mary’s
assumption. The rest either look toward Christ and Mary or toward the
empty tomb. The Golden Legend records that the assumption occurred on
the third day after Mary’s death.
 
The fresco is structurally intact, even retaining the blue color of the
sky. However, many of the apostles’ faces have eroded and the oxidation
of the paint’s white lead has obscured the scene by making the figures
appear as “negative” images.
