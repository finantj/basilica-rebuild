The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden
 
Fifth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters, Giotto Workshop? (c. 1288-90)
 
Genesis 3:22-24
 
Guilt is followed by sanction and the banishment from Paradise. Between
the scenes of the first sin and the one of punishment there are God’s
words spoken to the serpent and to Adam/Eve’s ancestors (Gen 3:15). Their
realization is here represented in the scene of the banishment from
Paradise. An Angel carries out God’s order. The fluctuating movement
of his robes and his bodily position express the rapidity of the
execution. The Angel is not carrying a sword (Gen 3:24). The fear and
the dread that overwhelm Adam and Eve are reflected in their bending
bodies. Yet, Eve’s glance back to the Angel suggests that they were not
banished without any possibility of return.
 
Within the context of the bay, the scene contrasts with Francis who is
offered a heavenly throne by an angel (lower register). Thus, while Adam
and Eve have been banished from paradise because of their unfaithfulness,
Francis is welcomed into paradise because of his faithfulness.
 
Besides the erosion of the angel’s torso, the fresco is well preserved.
