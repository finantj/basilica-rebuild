"Christ in Glory among Cherubs, Seraphs and Archangels (?)"
 
Fourth Scene in the Passion and Glory of Christ Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Matthew 25:31
 
The fresco is almost completely destroyed; just a few fragments within
the lunette are left. Yet, the vivid colors of the wings in the far
left indicate its previous grandeur. The few remaining pieces show
Christ holding a book in his left hand and granting benediction with
His right. Christ is surrounded by seraphim, cherubim and archangels,
in descending hierarchical order. Even with the fresco’s poor condition,
its theme probably represents Christ in glory, which parallels the fresco
of the Transfiguration over the other crucifixion scene.
 
Besides the fresco’s extensive destruction, the oxidation of the paint’s
white lead has further obscured the fresco by making the figures appear
as “negative” images.
