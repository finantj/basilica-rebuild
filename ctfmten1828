Christ Opens the Seventh Seal
 
Third Scene in the Visions of the Apocalypse Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Revelations 8:1-5
 
Christ sits within a four-ringed mandorla. He rises above the golden
altar that is before the throne of the Lamb. He extends his right hand
in a gesture of benediction. The seven angels with trumpets surround
Him: four on the left and three on the right. Below them on the right,
the angel of the seventh seal descends toward the multitude. The angel
carries a golden incense censer with which he offers the prayers of all
the saints before the altar. In the lower foreground, the saints, i.e.,
the one hundred forty-four thousand servants of God (Rev 7:3-4; 14:1),
kneel in adoration. The left center friar has the letter “D” for Deus
written on his forehead. Thus, he bears God’s seal.
 
The oxidation of the paint’s white lead has obscured the fresco by making
the figures appear as “negative” images. However, the angels red hue
and the blue mandorla hint at the fresco’s splendor now lost.
