Angels Visit Abraham
 
Twelfth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (1288-90)
 
Genesis 18:1-15
 
On the left, there is the representation of Abraham, bending towards
the ground but with his head looking up. By this respectful attitude
he welcomes the three visiting men, whose wings characterize them as
an apparition. The central personage, set a little more to the front,
is holding a rod and a halo surrounds his head. His hand is held out
to the bending, greeting Abraham. The other two angels hold scrolls in
their hands. The three winged figures take up the entire right side of
the scene. Behind Abraham there stands a tall tree, indicating the place
where Abraham will give hospitality to his visitors.
 
Within the context of the bay, the scene illustrates that just as God
spoke to Abraham through the angels, God also spoke to Francis via the
crucifix at San Damiano (lower register).
 
The fresco is badly damaged between the center and the left
side. Abraham’s face and hand gesture are no longer recognizable.
Nevertheless, the representation is unmistakable.
