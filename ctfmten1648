The Way to Calvary
 
Thirteenth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters (c. 1290)
 
Matthew 27:32-34; Mark 15:21-23; Luke 23:26-31; John 19:16-17
 
The large scale, red robe, and central position of Christ’s figure
graphically stress the importance of this representation. The cross on
Christ’s shoulders proceeds from right to left, following the development
of the fresco’s action. A soldier leads Jesus as other heavily armed
soldiers and a large crowd join the procession. Jesus is followed by
His mother and by another haloed woman.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene from Christ’s Passion mimics
the events of Francis’s death where he underwent a “passion” in imitation
of Christ (lower register). Specifically, the foot of Christ’s cross
points downward toward the dead Francis. Thus, just as Jesus journeys
toward his death, Francis follows Christ as he journeys toward his.
 
Unfortunately Mary’s face is missing, and several other areas of the
fresco are destroyed.
