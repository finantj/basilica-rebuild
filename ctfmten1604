The Creation of Adam
 
Second Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Genesis 1:26-31; 2:4-9
 
God the Father, dressed in a light-colored tunic and a red cloak, is
sitting on a celestial sphere, above which four rivers gush out and a few
trees are standing. They are the symbols of the garden of Eden. Among
them God has placed Adam. In His left hand God holds a written roll of
paper. With His right hand, God calls Adam to life from the earth by an
act of His divine will. Leaning on one arm, Adam gives a grateful look
at his Creator as he extends his right hand.
 
Within the context of the bay, the scene indicates that just as God
created Adam, Francis’s conversion is also a gracious gift from God
(lower register).
 
The fresco is partly destroyed, especially on the top right, and God’s
face has eroded. Nevertheless, the theme of the representation is clear.
