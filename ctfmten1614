Noah Builds the Ark
 
Ninth Fresco in the Scenes from the Old Testament Cycle
 
Roman Masters (1288-90)
 
Genesis 6:1-22
 
This fresco gives a double representation of Noah, who is not haloed. On
the left, Noah is a dignified figure with an aquiline nose and white
beard. He is turned to the center and raises his hands and eyes
heavenwards as he listens to God’s directives. Above him, against the
sky’s blue background, God’s hand protrudes from a three-ringed celestial
orb. The rays sent forth from His fingers shine down upon the patriarch’s
face. Noah wears the classical white tunic bordered with a purple stole
and a red mantle.
 
To the right, Noah’s execution of God’s order is represented. Here the
patriarch is painted again, but this time in a sitting position (a seat is
a symbol of authority in Byzantine painting). The three men who complete
the scene are not common workers; rather, they are Noah’s three sons:
Shem, Ham and Japheth. They occupy the whole right side of the scene.
 
Within the context of the bay, the new creation of Noah’s covenant
with God parallels Francis’s initial conversion and new life (lower
register). Specifically, God’s admonition to Noah to build the ark
relates to Christ’s exhortation to Francis to serve the Lord in the scene
depicting Francis’s dream a palace filled with weapons (lower register).
 
This fresco is well preserved, with the exception of the bottom right
figure.
