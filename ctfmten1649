The Crucifixion
 
Fourteenth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters (c. 1290)
 
Matthew 27:33-54; Mark 15:22-39; Luke 23:32-48; John 19:16-37
 
At the scene’s center there is the cross, which spans the fresco from
top to bottom. Christ has ended His suffering; He has passed away and
His head, with eyes closed, is reclined on his chest. All the persons
who remain at the foot of the cross are haloed. Besides the favorite
disciple John, on the right, only women are represented. The emotion on
their faces is intense. The four angels soaring around the upper part of
the scene express affliction and lament. Below the cross, the tomb of
Adam is clearly discernible, which symbolizes that the death of Adam’s
sin is overcome by Christ’s death. Large drops of blood fall down from
Christ’s wounded hand.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene illustrates that the wounds
of Christ’s crucifixion were truly present on Francis’s body, which the
knight verified (lower register).
 
The faces of all three women on the left have eroded, and part of John’s
face is missing. Likewise, the fresco’s upper left corner is destroyed,
which eliminates two angels.
