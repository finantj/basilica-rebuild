The Beheading of St Paul
 
Fifth Scene in the Lives of the Apostles Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Golden Legend 90
 
According to tradition, St Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign
of Nero. The fresco’s damage ruins much of the scene of the actual
beheading. However, a trace of Paul’s already decapitated head and
halo can be seen laying in the foreground. Likewise, the head of the
executioner is just visible to the left of the tree. Four different
groups of soldiers, holding spears and shields, watch the execution. A
three-story, non-descript building stands on the left.
 
Much of the fresco’s foreground is destroyed, and the oxidation of the
paint’s white lead has obscured the rest of the scene.
