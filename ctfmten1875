The Fall of Babylon
 
Fourth Scene in the Visions of the Apocalypse Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Revelation 18:1-24
 
In the top left corner, the angel descends from heaven, represented by
six concentric rings.  Below, the buildings of Babylon crumble as many
serpents, symbols of sin, flee from the destruction. Opening from the
city wall are two gates. On the left, God’s people, who “do not take
part in her sins” escape. Juxtaposed to the right, demons attempt to
exit the ruins as the one in the doorway blows a horn. Between the doors
there are representations of the foul spirits, birds and beasts mentioned
in Scripture.
 
A large central section of the fresco is ruined, and the oxidation of
the paint’s white lead has further obscured the fresco by making the
figures appear as “negative” images. However, the scene’s theme, which
is written in the lower left corner: “The angel of the Lord descends
from heaven,” still stands out clearly from the representation.
