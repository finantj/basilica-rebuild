The Rose Window
 
Completely restored 1892-98
 
The wheel within wheel configuration signifies Ezekiel’s vision (Ezek
1:1-28; 10:1-22). The initials IHS, a monogram for Jesus Christ, reside
in the center. In effect, the rose window symbolizes the revelation of
Jesus Christ, which inspires the pictorial narratives throughout all the
iconographic decorations. Revelation 4:1-11 employs Ezekiel’s vision to
describe John’s vision of God’s glory and the Lamb’s throne. Thus, just
as Ezekiel’s vision represents the revelation of Christ in Scripture,
that same vision depicted by the rose window presents the revelation of
Jesus Christ in the upper church.
