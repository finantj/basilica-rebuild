Archangel Michael Defeats the Dragon
 
Sixth Scene in the Visions of the Apocalypse Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Revelation 12:7-9
 
Framed by a lunette, the red-cloaked St Michael, with the two angels on
each side, stands within the concentric rings of a heavenly sphere. They
fight the dragon, i.e., Satan, and his accompanying demons, who fall
from heaven, cast down to the earth below. The dragon’s head, wings and
serpentine tail, can be seen directly below St Michael. The spear of
the angel to the right of St Michael pierces the dragon’s head and neck.
 
Besides the fresco’s destruction, the oxidation of the paint’s white
lead has further obscured the fresco by making the figures appear as
“negative” images.
