Christ Mocked and Scourged before Pilate
 
Twelfth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Roman and Building Masters (c. 1288-90)
 
Matthew 27:27-31; Mark 15:16-20; Luke 23:6-25; John 19: 1-7
 
The fresco is so damaged that it only allows a hypothesis. The
aristocratic figure on the left may be Pontius Pilate, and the figure
preserved in the center is in the act of scourging Jesus. The high pillar
to the left likely depicts the whipping post to which Jesus was tied.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene insinuates that those
who doubt Francis’s sanctity (lower register) mock Christ like the
scourging. Specifically, rejection of the stigmata is paramount to
rejecting Christ.
