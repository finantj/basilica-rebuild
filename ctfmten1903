The Virgin Mary 
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Two angels flank Mary on her left and right. The scene to the right
of Mary is unique in that the eroded plaster reveals three figures:
the angel, a female figure between the angel and Mary, and another
revealed face in front of the angel. Some suggest that the two figures
that accompany the angel are Anna and Joachim.
