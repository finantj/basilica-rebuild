1. Product Description
=================================================
VB1 is a virtual reconstruction of the Upper Church of the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi (Italy).  The reconstruction is a combination of 3D (game engine) modeling and over 4,000 digital images of the Upper Church--all captured prior to the disastrous earthquake of 1997.  The model is also real-time interactive so the user can choose to move through the model according to his/her own interests or curiosity.  The model is fully accessible through walk and fly modes.  The application also has text integrated into the environment, which describes each artistic object (and several other objects therein) and provides, where possible, the literary source(s) for the nature and/or content of the object.  Users have access to additional materials (summary descriptions of the space, bibliography, chronologies, schematic maps, etc).  Users can toggle between 1st/3rd person points of view. 






================================================
2. Installation Issues
================================================
VB1 can function in all Win 32-bit environments (2000/NT/ME/XP, Win98 is not recommended), and requires the minimum system configuration: 

Pentium IV, 2GHz
512 MB RAM 	 (1GB recommended)
64 MB Video Card (128GB recommended)
500 MB Free Space 
Sound Card
32x/2x CD/DVD Speed

The minimum RAM is physical memory and not paged memory on the hard drive.  

VB1 also requires DirectX 9.0 installed.  If your system does not have this version, it can be obtained free of charge from www.microsoft.com.

Installation automatically begins when the CD-ROM is inserted in the drive.  If you have disabled autoinstall on your system, then select the RUN option from the START menu and type 

	[dr]:\setup.exe

where [dr] is the letter drive assigned to your CD/DVD drive. The Installation process is self-explanatory. NOTE: after installation, the CD-ROM must be in the CD/DVD drive in order for the application to function. 

Installation should place two new icons on your desktop, one that will begin the application and another to uninstall VB1.  If you cannot locate the icon to run VB1, you can type the following command line from the RUN option of the START menu:

	c:\Program Files\Institute of Digital Theology\Basilica of St. Francis\basilicaFinal2exe -nc

assuming you permitted installation in the default location. 


VB1 does not function in any Unix flavor environment (including Linux boxes) nor on Mac OS systems unless a virtual Win machine is operational (eg. Bootcamp). 






================================================
3. Performance Issues
================================================
1. Close all other applications before running VB1.  The more applications running in the background, the slower VB1 will perform.

2. Set the resolution of your display device or monitor to its highest setting.  Please consult Windows HELP for details on how to determine or select display resolution.

3. VB1 does not work with the Intel 8-x onboard graphics chipsets.  You will have to disable the on-board graphics and install a new graphics card.
