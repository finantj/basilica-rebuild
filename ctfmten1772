Jesus Christ and Two Angels
 
Vault of the Intercessors
 
Jacopo Torriti’s Workshop (c. 1288-90)
 
Jesus holds a scroll in his left hand and offers benediction with
his right. The three other figures in the vault all point to Christ,
signifying that they are intercessors who convey the prayers of the
faithful to Christ.
 
The inscription reads:
Jesus Christ King of Glory
