The Papal Throne 
 
Roman Marble Workshop (c. 1250-60)
 
The papal throne sits atop four steps underneath an aedicule supported
by two columns of red marble. The aedicule’s triangular gable contains
a recessed trefoil: a symbol for the Trinity. The gable’s decorative
stonework with imitative mosaic design matches that of the papal throne
underneath. The throne’s armrests, also cut from red marble, depict lions
standing over their prey. The throne’s footrest depicts a lion, an asp,
a basilisk, and a dragon, over which the papal power symbolically asserts
itself. The imagery is drawn from Psalm 91:13.
