The Vision of the Adoration of the Lamb
 
First Scene in the Visions of the Apocalypse Cycle
 
Cimabue Workshop (c. 1277-80)
 
Revelations 4:1-5:14
 
Within a three-ringed mandorla, Christ the Lamb sits atop a throne. Above
the Lamb there is the book “written inside and out” with seven bookmark
tassels, representing the seven seals. On each side of the throne are the
four living creatures depicted as symbols of the four gospels: top left
eagle for John, top right man for Matthew, lower right ox for Luke, and
lower left lion for Mark. Beyond the living creatures are the twenty-four
elders with crowns on their heads; the two in front hold harps and bowls
full of incense. Behind the elders there are twenty-seven Angels who
join in the worship of the Lamb.
 
The oxidation of the paint’s white lead has obscured the fresco by making
the figures appear as “negative” images. However, Christ’s mandorla
offers a glimpse of the fresco’s color.
