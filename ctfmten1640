The Baptism of Jesus
 
Eighth Fresco in the Scenes from the New Testament Cycle
 
Building Masters, Giotto Workshop (c. 1290)
 
Matthew 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22; John 1:29-34
 
In the scene’s center, a naked Jesus stands with His arms lowered,
immersed into the water up to His hips. The Holy Spirit, symbolized
as a dove, descends upon Him. In the water, depicted in the Byzantine
tradition with wavy blue lines, some fishes dart to and fro. On the right
and the left sides of the picture, there rise some rocks upon which John
the Baptist and two angels carrying Jesus’ clothes are represented.
 
Within the context of the bay, this scene shows that just as Jesus was
sealed by the Spirit’s power, Francis’s preaching is inspired by the
Spirit in the four scenes below (lower register).
 
Much of the fresco is destroyed and Christ’s face is obscured, but half
of his radiant cross nimbus is clearly visible.
